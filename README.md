# OHRI Docs

This is the repository for the OHRI documentation site based on [Nextra](https://nextra.site).

[**Live Demo →**](https://ohri-docs.globalhealthapp.net/)

## Quick Start

OHRI Forms is a React component that renders forms based on the AMPATH Forms Builder. The AMPATH forms are well defined here. OHRI Forms:

- Use the same schema as the AMPATH Forms Builder.
- May not implement all features from the AMPATH Forms Builder (yet).
- May define some extensions to the schema specific to OHRI to implement functionality needed by OHRI (such functionality may be suggested back to the AMPATH Forms Builder team for their consideration to include).
- Renders forms based on the Carbon Design system using React.
